### Detection of objects with reflective properties 
Analyzed the effect of depth to detect reflective objects such as mirrors in images.

### 3D Shape Modeling using Multi-view Depth Maps 
Proposed a framework to model and synthesize 3D shapes from depth maps. 


<!-- <b> ![Scene Text Detection And Recognition](https://jsreddy.github.io/images/detected_text.png)</b>
    Experimented with a two stage network to detect text from natural images. 

<b> ![Brand Logo Detection](https://jsreddy.github.io/images/logo.jpg)</b>
    Trained FasterRCNN for detecting logos in natural images. The project also explores methods to detect logos using visual features from a few number of reference images

<b> ![Representation Learning and Random Projections for Sparse Data](https://jsreddy.github.io/images/mtp.png)</b>
    Experimented with various hashing techniques for dimensionality reduction. We also explored multi-task setting for Named Entity Disambiguation(NED).

<b> ![Classifying Thermographic features for Breast Cancer Screening](https://jsreddy.github.io/images/breast_cancer.jpg)</b>
    Designed an algorithm to automatically classify thermographic images for the presence of breast cancer. We also enable automatic detection of the suspected malignant regions in images taken from various angles.
